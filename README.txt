A hand game called "Rock Paper Scissors" is often played by two players, who simultaneously make one of three shapes with their outstretched hands. These are the "scissors," "paper," and "rock" shapes, respectively (fingers forming a V). A player who chooses to play rock will defeat a player who has selected scissors, but will fall short against a player who has selected paper; a play of paper will fall short against a play of scissors. The game is usually promptly replayed to break the tie if both players select the same shape.
